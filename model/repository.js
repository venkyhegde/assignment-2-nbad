        author: "Harper Lee",
        note: "To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel by Harper Lee published in 1960. It was immediately successful, winning the Pulitzer Prize, and has become a classic of modern American literature. The plot and characters are loosely based on Lee's observations of her family, her neighbors and an event that occurred near her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama, in 1936, when she was 10 years old. The story is told by the six-year-old Jean Louise Finch.",
        description: "Born in 1926, Harper Lee grew up in the Southern town of Monroeville, Alabama, where she became close friends with soon-to-be famous writer Truman Capote. She attended Huntingdon College in Montgomery (1944–45), and then studied law at the University of Alabama (1945–49). While attending college, she wrote for campus literary magazines: Huntress at Huntingdon and the humor magazine Rammer Jammer at the University of Alabama. At both colleges, she wrote short stories and other works about racial injustice, a rarely mentioned topic on such campuses at the time.[4] In 1950, Lee moved to New York City, where she worked as a reservation clerk for British Overseas Airways Corporation; there, she began writing a collection of essays and short stories about people in Monroeville. Hoping to be published, Lee presented her writing in 1957 to a literary agent recommended by Capote. An editor at J. B. Lippincott, who bought the manuscript, advised her to quit the airline and concentrate on writing.",

        description: "In the far future, humanity has eschewed advanced computers in favor of adapting their minds to be capable of extremely complex tasks. Much of this is enabled by the spice melange, which is only found on Arrakis, a desert planet with giant sandworms as its most notable native lifeform. Melange improves general health, extends life and can bestow limited prescience, and its rarity makes it a form of currency in the interstellar empire. Melange allows the Spacing Guild's Navigators to safely route faster-than-light travel between planets, and helps the Reverend Mothers of the matriarchal Bene Gesserit to access their Other Memory, the ego and experiences of their female ancestors. As the novel opens, each planet is ruled by a Great House that owes allegiance to the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV. The Emperor suspects that Duke Leto Atreides of House Atreides has become a potential challenger to his throne as Leto gains favor with other Great Houses in the Landsraad. The Emperor seeks the downfall of House Atreides by assigning them control of Arrakis, currently ruled by Baron Vladimir Harkonnen of House Harkonnen. The Atreides and Harkonnen houses have had a generations-long feud, and the Emperor secretly plots with the Baron to attack House Atreides after its move to Arrakis. While masking his involvement in the Baron's attack, the Emperor plans to ensure its success by deploying some of his elite Sardaukar troopers in Harkonnen disguise.",
